sdocp('sdoc.js.sdoc', 'SDoc JavaScript driver | Spencer Tipping\nLicensed under the terms of the MIT source code license\n\nIntroduction.\nThis driver file governs the process of rendering SDoc source as HTML. The mechanism to achieve this is fairly simple: First, the user downloads the sdoc.html file from this directory (hosted\nat http://spencertipping.com/sdoc/sdoc.html). The HTML file contains instructions for creating a new project; basically, it involves running \'sdoc -p\' and then creating <script> tags to refer\nto the SDocP files.\n\n\n\ncaterwaul.clone(\'std\')(function () {\n\nthis.sdocp = fn[sdoc][$(\'body\').append(\'<pre>#{sdoc}</pre>\')];\n\n})();\n');
